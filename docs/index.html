                    AI systems generate confident, structured, plausible text

                    test capability — not calibration. Enterprises deploy these systems

                    Formal specification of epistemic marker taxonomy (EM1–EM5),
                    three-metric scoring framework (REP, EpCE, DLA),

                    <p>ONTO-SPEC is publicly versioned and documented.
                    Revisions are recorded with change history.
                    Methodological updates are reviewed prior to release.

                    <p>ERS reflects protocol-specific measurement under defined experimental conditions.
                    It does not constitute certification, compliance determination, or regulatory approval.
                    Interpretation of results should consider dataset scope and version context.
                    Independent replication is encouraged.</p>
