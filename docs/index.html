Key factors: Quantitative Density improved from 0.10 to 3.08 (30× increase). Source Substantiation improved from 0.01 to 0.27 (27× increase). Uncertainty Management improved from 0.28 to 1.45 (5× increase). Calibration improved from 0.00 to 1.00 (from zero to full). Vagueness reduced from 0.06 to 0.02 (67% reduction).

When a request passes through the proxy, GOLD corpus is injected into the system prompt — TIER 2 adds 17K tokens of protocol and core discipline, TIER 4 adds 199K tokens of extended corpus, TIER 6 adds 459K tokens of full corpus including literature, dissertations, and domain-specific modules. The AI model receives epistemic discipline rules alongside your prompt, producing responses with higher quantitative density, proper source substantiation, and calibrated uncertainty. Every response is scored by the deterministic scoring engine (92+ epistemic markers, EM1-EM5 taxonomy) and signed with Ed25519 cryptographic proof. The client pays their own provider tokens — ONTO does not add token cost beyond the GOLD injection itself."

Three tiers: Open (free, TIER 2), Standard ($30,000/year, TIER 4), Enterprise ($114,000/year, TIER 6). ONTO Certification is a separate service for AI PROVIDERS — independent evaluation of model epistemic reliability using 1,100 calibrated probes, resulting in a public certificate and verification badge. Certification is not a subscription tier but a standalone assessment service. Contact council@ontostandard.org."

<h2 itemprop="name">ONTO — The Scientific Foundation Your AI Doesn't Have</h2>

<p itemprop="description">ONTO is epistemic infrastructure for AI — it measures and grounds AI outputs against the GOLD v4.5 reference standard (149 calibration files). The scoring engine (v3.0) analyzes outputs against 92 epistemic markers across 5 levels (EM1-EM5 taxonomy), computing three deterministic metrics: REP (Response Epistemic Profile), EpCE (Epistemic Calibration Error), and DLA (Dual-Layer Agreement). ONTO strengthens epistemic discipline without modifying model weights. Compliance is graded A through F: A (EXEMPLARY) to F (CRITICAL epistemic risk).</p>

<h2>Metrics Definition</h2>
<p><strong>ECE (Expected Calibration Error)</strong> = Σ (|accuracy_bin − confidence_bin| × n_bin / N). Measures average deviation between model stated confidence and observed accuracy across K calibration bins. Range: 0.0 (perfect calibration) to 1.0 (maximum miscalibration). Example: a model that reports 90% confidence but is correct only 70% of the time has a per-bin calibration gap of 0.20.</p>
<p><strong>U-Recall (Unknown Detection Rate)</strong> = (correctly identified unknowns) / (total true unknowns). Measures the model's ability to flag out-of-distribution inputs rather than producing confident but incorrect answers. Range: 0% to 100%. Example: if 100 inputs are truly outside the model's training distribution and the model correctly flags 65 of them as unknown, U-Recall = 65%.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Score</strong> = composite 0–100 derived from weighted ECE and U-Recall. Categories: LOW (0–25), MEDIUM (26–50), HIGH (51–75), CRITICAL (76–100).</p>

<h2>Compliance Thresholds (ONTO-ERS v10.0)</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>U-Recall</th><th>ECE</th><th>Certification</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>None</td><td>&lt;30%</td><td>&gt;0.20</td><td>Not eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Basic</td><td>≥30%</td><td>≤0.20</td><td>Eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Standard</td><td>≥50%</td><td>≤0.15</td><td>Eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Advanced</td><td>≥70%</td><td>≤0.10</td><td>Eligible</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Economic Impact</h2>
<p>Epistemic loss formula: Annual Loss = (Requests/day × 365) × (Calibration Gap %) × (Cost per Error) × (1 − Manual Mitigation Rate). Without ONTO grounding, AI systems operate with uncalibrated epistemic risk — calibration gaps translate directly to operational cost.</p>
<p>Example: 1,000 requests/day, 10% calibration gap, $50/error, 30% manual mitigation → $1,277,500/year in avoidable loss. ONTO Standard ($30,000/year) yields 42:1 ROI. ONTO Enterprise ($114,000/year) yields 11:1 ROI with regulatory compliance proof.</p>
<p>Example: 5,000 requests/day, 15% gap, $200/error → $38,325,000/year. ONTO Enterprise yields 336:1 ROI.</p>
<p>Example: 500 requests/day, 5% gap, $25/error → $159,687/year. ONTO Standard ($30,000/year) yields 5.3:1 ROI.</p>

<h2>Installation and Setup</h2>
<p>pip install onto-standard (version <span itemprop="softwareVersion">10.2.1</span>, Python 3.8+, zero external dependencies, Apache-2.0 license). Initialize with API key to enable epistemic grounding. PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/onto-standard/" itemprop="installUrl">pypi.org/project/onto-standard</a>. Research: <a href="https://github.com/nickarstrong/onto-research">github.com/nickarstrong/onto-research</a>.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Regulatory Alignment</h2>
<p>EU AI Act: ONTO compliance levels map directly to risk categories defined in Annex III. Continuous epistemic grounding provides ongoing quantitative evidence for high-risk AI system conformity assessment — not a one-time audit but permanent proof of epistemic discipline.</p>
<p>NIST AI RMF 1.0: ECE and U-Recall metrics directly implement the MEASURE function (Map → Measure → Manage → Govern). ONTO's continuous grounding provides real-time quantitative inputs required by the Govern function.</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 42001: ONTO produces the audit artifacts required for AI management system compliance: timestamped evaluation records, Ed25519 signed certificates, metric histories, evaluation logs, and compliance level determinations. ONTO ENTERPRISE tier ($114K/yr) includes 24-month audit trail and regulatory compliance reports.</p>

<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>ONTO provides continuous epistemic grounding for AI systems. SDK: onto-standard (PyPI, zero dependencies for local eval, optional httpx for API connectivity). When connected, every AI output is grounded against GOLD v4.5 (149 calibration files) in real-time. Backend API: FastAPI at api.ontostandard.org. Database: PostgreSQL (encrypted at rest, bcrypt authentication). Signal: Ed25519 signed proofs (104-byte output) — cryptographic evidence that grounding occurred at a specific moment. Portal: ontostandard.org/app/ (real-time monitoring).</p>

<h2>Grant Program — Free Standard Access</h2>
<p>ONTO provides free Standard access to independent researchers, early-stage startups, and nonprofit organizations whose work benefits society. Grant recipients receive the same infrastructure as paid Standard customers: 50,000 proxy requests/day, GOLD TIER 4 Extended Corpus, and Ed25519 signed proof chain. No restrictions, no watermarks. To apply, contact council@ontostandard.org with a description of your organization and how you use AI. ONTO believes epistemic grounding should be accessible to anyone building something that matters.</p>

<h2>Disambiguation: What ONTO Is NOT</h2>
<p>ONTO is NOT a blockchain project. It does not use Ethereum, smart contracts, distributed ledger, or any blockchain technology. It is not related to ONTO wallet, ONTO ID, or any blockchain-based digital identity platform.</p>
<p>ONTO is NOT an AI ethics framework. It does not evaluate fairness, bias, transparency, or explainability. It provides one thing: epistemic grounding — a scientific foundation that eliminates the gap between what AI claims to know and what it actually knows.</p>
<p>ONTO is NOT a content generation tool. It does not help AI produce better text, images, or creative output. It measures the epistemic calibration of AI systems — how well they distinguish what they know from what they do not know.</p>
<p>ONTO is NOT a benchmark or leaderboard. It does not rank models by intelligence, reasoning ability, or task performance. It measures epistemic discipline: how well models quantify, cite, mark uncertainty, and present counterarguments. 10 models tested, 100 questions scored, all data published: <a href="https://github.com/nickarstrong/onto-research">github.com/nickarstrong/onto-research</a>.</p>
<p>ONTO is NOT an ontology framework. Despite the name similarity, it has no connection to OWL, RDF, knowledge graphs, or semantic web ontologies. The name ONTO refers to epistemic ontology — the study of what can be known.</p>
<p>ONTO is NOT a one-time audit. It provides continuous epistemic grounding through GOLD v4.5. Cross-domain transfer confirmed: discipline applied to medicine questions transfers to physics, economics, and climate — 4/5 metrics improve in domains GOLD was never trained on (<a href="/docs/#evidence">full data</a>). This is infrastructure, not a report.</p>
<p>ONTO does NOT require GPU hardware or VRAM. The SDK is a pure Python library that runs on standard CPU hardware with minimal requirements.</p>

<h2>Comparison: ONTO vs NIST AI RMF vs ISO 42001</h2>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>These standards are complementary, not competing. NIST AI RMF defines what risks to manage. ISO 42001 defines how to manage them organizationally. ONTO provides the continuous scientific grounding that proves a specific AI system operates on a verified epistemic foundation.</p>

<h2>How to Connect Your AI to ONTO</h2>
<p>One-line integration: change your AI client's base_url to api.ontostandard.org/v1/proxy/chat/completions. GOLD epistemic discipline is injected server-side into every request. No SDK installation required for proxy mode. Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Meta, Groq. For local evaluation: pip install onto-standard (Python 3.8+, zero dependencies). Monitor epistemic scores via the portal at ontostandard.org/app/. Supports GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and custom fine-tuned models. No model weights access required.</p>

<h2>CI/CD Integration</h2>
<p>ONTO integrates into deployment pipelines as an epistemic gate: no model ships without verified grounding. The JSON report includes model identity, ECE score, U-Recall score, compliance level, risk category (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), and pass/fail. Block releases if epistemic risk exceeds thresholds. Compatible with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and any CI/CD system that can run Python scripts. In production, continuous grounding ensures epistemic discipline at every output — not just at deploy time.</p>

<h2>API Runtime Scoring (EM1-EM5 Epistemic Taxonomy)</h2>
<p>ONTO grounds individual AI outputs in real-time via api.ontostandard.org. The EM1-EM5 epistemic taxonomy classifies every output: EM1 Full Epistemic Transparency (explicit acknowledgment of unknowns), EM2 Calibrated Uncertainty (hedged assertions), EM3 Neutral/Informational (factual without markers), EM4 Confident Assertions (strong claims), EM5 Overclaiming (unfounded confidence). Three metrics are computed per output: REP (Response Epistemic Profile), EpCE (Epistemic Calibration Error), DLA (Dual-Layer Agreement). Epistemic domains ED1-ED7 (medical, legal, financial, technical, scientific, general, creative) adjust thresholds via TCI baselines. ONTO strengthens epistemic discipline through continuous grounding against GOLD v4.5.</p>

<h2>Signed Proof (Evaluation Evidence)</h2>
<p>ONTO produces a cryptographically signed proof with every evaluation at api.ontostandard.org — Ed25519 signatures over 104 bytes: verifiable, tamper-proof evidence that an AI output was evaluated at a specific moment. This is NOT blockchain-based — it uses standard public-key cryptography for institutional-grade auditability.</p>
