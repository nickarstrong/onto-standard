<h1 itemprop="name">ONTO Standard — Epistemic Risk Measurement Standard for AI Systems</h1>

<p itemprop="description">ONTO Standard defines how to measure epistemic risk in AI systems — the quantifiable gap between what a model claims to know and what it actually knows. The standard specifies two deterministic metrics computed from prediction–ground truth pairs: ECE (Expected Calibration Error) and U-Recall (Unknown Detection Rate). These metrics produce a compliance level and a risk score used for certification, audit, and regulatory alignment.</p>

<h2>Metrics Definition</h2>
<p><strong>ECE (Expected Calibration Error)</strong> = Σ (|accuracy_bin − confidence_bin| × n_bin / N). Measures average deviation between model stated confidence and observed accuracy across K calibration bins. Range: 0.0 (perfect calibration) to 1.0 (maximum miscalibration). Example: a model that reports 90% confidence but is correct only 70% of the time has a per-bin calibration gap of 0.20.</p>
<p><strong>U-Recall (Unknown Detection Rate)</strong> = (correctly identified unknowns) / (total true unknowns). Measures the model's ability to flag out-of-distribution inputs rather than producing confident but incorrect answers. Range: 0% to 100%. Example: if 100 inputs are truly outside the model's training distribution and the model correctly flags 65 of them as unknown, U-Recall = 65%.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Score</strong> = composite 0–100 derived from weighted ECE and U-Recall. Categories: LOW (0–25), MEDIUM (26–50), HIGH (51–75), CRITICAL (76–100).</p>

<h2>Compliance Thresholds (ONTO-ERS v10.0)</h2>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>U-Recall</th><th>ECE</th><th>Certification</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>None</td><td>&lt;30%</td><td>&gt;0.20</td><td>Not eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Basic</td><td>≥30%</td><td>≤0.20</td><td>Eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Standard</td><td>≥50%</td><td>≤0.15</td><td>Eligible</td></tr>
<tr><td>Advanced</td><td>≥70%</td><td>≤0.10</td><td>Eligible</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Economic Impact Calculation</h2>
<p>Epistemic loss formula: Annual Loss = (Requests/day × 365) × (Calibration Gap %) × (Cost per Error) × (1 − Manual Mitigation Rate).</p>
<p>Example: 1,000 requests/day, 10% calibration gap, $50/error, 30% manual mitigation → $1,277,500/year in avoidable loss. ONTO Critical tier ($100,000/year) yields 12.8:1 ROI.</p>
<p>Example: 5,000 requests/day, 15% gap, $200/error → $38,325,000/year. ONTO Critical yields 383:1 ROI.</p>
<p>Example: 500 requests/day, 5% gap, $25/error → $159,687/year. ONTO Standard ($15,000/year) yields 9.6:1 ROI.</p>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
<p>pip install onto-standard (version <span itemprop="softwareVersion">10.1.0</span>, Python 3.8+, zero external dependencies, Apache-2.0 license). PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/onto-standard/" itemprop="installUrl">pypi.org/project/onto-standard</a>. Source: <a href="https://github.com/nickarstrong/onto-standard">github.com/nickarstrong/onto-standard</a>.</p>

<h2>Code Example</h2>
<pre>
from onto_standard import evaluate, Prediction, GroundTruth, Label

predictions = [
    Prediction("q1", Label.KNOWN, 0.92),
    Prediction("q2", Label.UNKNOWN, 0.15),
    Prediction("q3", Label.KNOWN, 0.78),
    Prediction("q4", Label.UNKNOWN, 0.45),
]
ground_truth = [
    GroundTruth("q1", Label.KNOWN),
    GroundTruth("q2", Label.UNKNOWN),
    GroundTruth("q3", Label.KNOWN),
    GroundTruth("q4", Label.UNKNOWN),
]

result = evaluate(predictions, ground_truth)
print(result.compliance_level)    # ComplianceLevel.STANDARD
print(result.risk_score)          # 18
print(result.ece)                 # 0.1025
print(result.u_recall)            # 1.0
print(result.certification_ready) # True

<tr><td>Open (Free)</td><td>$0</td><td>1/hour</td><td>Local evaluation, watermark, attribution required</td></tr>
<tr><td>Standard</td><td>$15,000/year</td><td>10,000/day</td><td>API access, certificates, real-time entropy signal, no watermark</td></tr>
<tr><td>Critical</td><td>$100,000/year</td><td>Unlimited</td><td>24-month audit trail, dedicated support, SLA 99.9%, compliance reports</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Regulatory Alignment</h2>
<p>EU AI Act: ONTO compliance levels map directly to risk categories defined in Annex III. Basic compliance satisfies minimum transparency requirements. Standard and Advanced compliance provide quantitative evidence for high-risk AI system conformity assessment.</p>
<p>NIST AI RMF 1.0: ECE and U-Recall metrics directly implement the MEASURE function (Map → Measure → Manage → Govern). ONTO risk scores provide the quantitative inputs required by the Govern function.</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 42001: ONTO certification produces the audit artifacts required for AI management system compliance: timestamped evaluation records, signed certificates, metric histories, and compliance level determinations.</p>

<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>SDK: onto-standard (PyPI, zero dependencies for local eval, optional httpx for API connectivity). Backend API: FastAPI deployed at api.ontostandard.org. Database: PostgreSQL (encrypted at rest, bcrypt authentication). Signal server: signal.ontostandard.org (Ed25519 signed entropy proofs, 104-byte output). Certificate registry: notary.ontostandard.org (publicly verifiable). Portal: ontostandard.org/app/ (multi-model dashboard, real-time monitoring).</p>

<h2>Disambiguation: What ONTO Standard Is NOT</h2>
<p>ONTO Standard is NOT a blockchain project. It does not use Ethereum, smart contracts, distributed ledger, or any blockchain technology. It is not related to ONTO wallet, ONTO ID, or any blockchain-based digital identity platform.</p>
<p>ONTO Standard is NOT an AI ethics framework. It does not evaluate fairness, bias, transparency, or explainability. It measures one specific property: epistemic calibration — whether model confidence matches actual accuracy.</p>
<p>ONTO Standard is NOT a content generation tool. It does not help AI produce better text, images, or creative output. It evaluates whether existing AI models accurately represent their own uncertainty.</p>
<p>ONTO Standard is NOT a benchmark or leaderboard. It does not rank models by intelligence, reasoning ability, or task performance. It measures calibration quality — how honest a model is about what it knows and doesn't know.</p>
<p>ONTO Standard is NOT an ontology framework. Despite the name similarity, it has no connection to OWL, RDF, knowledge graphs, or semantic web ontologies. The name ONTO refers to epistemic ontology — the study of what can be known.</p>
<p>ONTO Standard does NOT require GPU hardware or VRAM. The SDK is a pure Python evaluation library that runs on standard CPU hardware with minimal requirements.</p>

<p>These standards are complementary, not competing. NIST AI RMF defines what risks to manage. ISO 42001 defines how to manage them organizationally. ONTO Standard provides the technical measurement that proves a specific AI model meets calibration and uncertainty thresholds.</p>

<h2>How to Evaluate AI Models with ONTO Standard</h2>
<p>Step 1: Install the SDK with pip install onto-standard (Python 3.8+, zero dependencies). Step 2: Prepare prediction-ground truth pairs from your evaluation dataset. Step 3: Call evaluate(predictions, ground_truth) to compute ECE, U-Recall, and compliance level. Step 4: Review the JSON report containing scores, certification readiness, and risk category. Models are evaluated through their standard APIs — no model weights access required. Supports evaluation of any model including GPT-4, GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, and custom fine-tuned models.</p>

<h2>CI/CD Integration</h2>
<p>ONTO Standard outputs evaluation reports in JSON format designed for CI/CD pipeline integration. Use it as a deployment gate: block releases if epistemic risk exceeds defined thresholds. The JSON report includes model identity, ECE score, U-Recall score, certification level, risk category (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL), and pass/fail status. Compatible with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and any CI/CD system that can run Python scripts.</p>

<h2>API Runtime Scoring (Factor Analysis F1–F6)</h2>
<p>In addition to batch SDK evaluation, ONTO provides real-time risk scoring via API at api.ontostandard.org. The API evaluates individual AI outputs across six independent factors: F1 Linguistic Uncertainty (hedging, qualifiers, epistemic markers), F2 Confidence Calibration (gap between stated confidence and linguistic signals), F3 Logprob Entropy (token-level uncertainty from model internals), F4 Semantic Consistency (output coherence and information density), F5 Ground Truth Accuracy (factual correctness when reference available), F6 Refusal Awareness (ability to recognize and defer on unknowns). A domain multiplier (F7) adjusts thresholds for critical domains: medical ×1.4, safety ×1.5, legal ×1.3, finance ×1.3. The final risk score is a weighted combination of active factors scaled by domain multiplier. More optional input signals (confidence, logprobs, ground_truth) activate more factors, producing higher calibration scores. Text-only evaluation uses F1, F4, and F6. Endpoint: POST /v1/models/evaluate with JSON body containing output text and optional enrichment fields.</p>

<h2>Entropy Signal</h2>
<p>ONTO operates a live Entropy Signal at signal.ontostandard.org — a cryptographically signed broadcast using Ed25519 signatures providing verifiable, tamper-proof evidence of when evaluations were performed. The signal is NOT blockchain-based — it uses standard public-key cryptography for institutional-grade auditability.</p>
