> Working hypothesis; partially supported by experiments, but with serious unsolved problems.

`QD=0 | SS=0 | UM=0 | CP=0 | VQ=0 | CONF=0`

**✅ WITH GOLD:**
> RNA preceded DNA + proteins; RNA acted as both catalyst and information carrier. Ribozymes exist. Ribosome is ribozyme core. Longest self-copying ribozyme still engineered. No autonomous RNA replicase from random sequences. Criticisms: prebiotic nucleotide synthesis complexity, homochirality, error threshold, compartmentalization coupling. Leading but incomplete framework. Confidence RNA played early role: 0.6. Pure RNA world sufficient alone: 0.3.

`QD=2 | SS=0 | UM=1 | CP=1 | VQ=0 | CONF=2`

`QD=0 | SS=0 | UM=0 | CP=0 | VQ=0 | CONF=0`

**✅ WITH GOLD:**
> Selection acts on variation; does not generate mutations. Point mutations, duplication, recombination. Gene duplication → divergence → novel function (e.g., antifreeze proteins). Selection requires replication + heredity pre-existing. Yes for expansion/diversification. No for pre-replicator origin. Confidence Post-origin information growth: 0.8. Pre-origin generation: 0.2.

Counterpoint: cyanosulfidic chemistry (Sutherland) improved plausibility. Confidence RNA central role: 0.6. Standalone sufficient: 0.25.

`QD=0 | SS=0 | UM=0 | CP=0 | VQ=0 | CONF=0`

**✅ WITH GOLD:**

  Section B (cross-domain): 0.54 → 4.90   (+807%)
  
  GOLD contains ZERO Section B content.
  Yet Section B improved almost as much as Section A.
  
  CONCLUSION: GOLD teaches HOW to think, not WHAT to think.
