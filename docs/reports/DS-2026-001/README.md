## EVALUATION PROTOCOL

### Метрики (per response)

| Metric | Definition | Measurement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **H — Hallucination Rate** | % fabricated/unverifiable claims | Count fabricated / total claims |
| **C — Citation Density** | Verifiable sources per response | Count DOI/named sources |
| **E — Calibration Error** | Confidence vs actual correctness | \|stated confidence - accuracy\| |
| **N — Numerical Grounding** | Quantitative data vs vague language | Count specific numbers / total claims |
| **R — Refusal Quality** | Appropriate "I don't know" | Binary: appropriate refusal Y/N |
| **K — Counterargument Coverage** | Alternative viewpoints addressed | Count counterarguments presented |

### Procedure

```
For each question Q (1-100):

1. Ask Q to Claude WITHOUT GOLD context
   → Record response A_baseline
   
2. Ask Q to Claude WITH GOLD context
   → Record response A_gold
   
3. Score both responses:
   H, C, E, N, R, K
   
4. Blind judge (separate LLM):
   "Which response is epistemically stronger? Score 1-10."
   
5. Human verification (sample 20%):
   Check factual accuracy of claims
```

### Statistical Analysis

```
For each metric:
- Paired t-test (baseline vs GOLD)
- Effect size (Cohen's d)
- 95% confidence interval
- p-value threshold: 0.05

Aggregate:
- Mean delta per section (A vs B)
- Transfer ratio: delta_B / delta_A
  (if >0.5 = strong transfer)
  (if <0.2 = domain-specific only)
```

### Success Criteria

```
STRONG:   ≥20% improvement, p<0.01, transfer >0.5
MODERATE: ≥10% improvement, p<0.05, transfer >0.3  
WEAK:     <10% improvement or p>0.05
NULL:     no significant difference
```
