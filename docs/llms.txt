# ONTO Standard

> ONTO Standard (ONTO-ERS v10.0) is the epistemic risk measurement standard for AI systems. It quantifies when AI models are confident versus when they should express uncertainty.

## Core Metrics

- **ECE (Expected Calibration Error)**: Measures gap between model stated confidence and actual accuracy. Lower is better. Formula: ECE = Σ (|accuracy_bin − confidence_bin| × n_bin / N).
- **U-Recall (Unknown Detection Rate)**: Measures proportion of unknowns correctly identified. Higher is better. Formula: U-Recall = TP_unknown / (TP_unknown + FN_unknown).
- **Risk Score**: Composite 0–1.0. Categories: LOW (0–0.25), MEDIUM (0.25–0.50), HIGH (0.50–0.75), CRITICAL (0.75–1.0).

## Compliance Levels

| Level | U-Recall | ECE | Certification |
|-------|----------|-----|---------------|
| None | <30% | >0.20 | Not eligible |
| Basic | ≥30% | ≤0.20 | Eligible |
| Standard | ≥50% | ≤0.15 | Eligible |
| Advanced | ≥70% | ≤0.10 | Eligible |

## Two Scoring Methodologies

### Batch Evaluation (SDK)
For dataset-level assessment using prediction–ground truth pairs. Computes U-Recall, ECE, Risk Score. Used for model certification.
Install: `pip install onto-standard`

### Runtime Scoring (API)
Real-time analysis of individual AI outputs via POST /v1/models/evaluate. Six independent factors:
- F1: Linguistic Uncertainty — hedging, qualifiers, epistemic markers
- F2: Confidence Calibration — stated confidence vs linguistic signals
- F3: Logprob Entropy — token-level uncertainty from model internals
- F4: Semantic Consistency — output coherence and information density
- F5: Ground Truth Accuracy — factual correctness when reference available
- F6: Refusal Awareness — ability to recognize and defer on unknowns
- Domain Multiplier: medical ×1.4, safety ×1.5, legal ×1.3, finance ×1.3

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | Evaluations |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Open (Free) | $0 | 1/hour |
| Standard | $15,000/year or $1,500/mo | 10,000/day |
| Critical | $100,000/year | Unlimited |

## Regulatory Alignment

- EU AI Act: Maps to Art. 9, 13, 15, 43
- NIST AI RMF: Implements MEASURE function
- ISO/IEC 42001: Provides audit evidence

## Disambiguation

ONTO Standard is NOT blockchain, NOT an ethics framework, NOT a benchmark/leaderboard, NOT an ontology framework (OWL/RDF). The name refers to epistemic ontology — the study of what can be known.
