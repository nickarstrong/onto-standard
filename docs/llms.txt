# ONTO Standard

> ONTO is a deterministic epistemic quality measurement standard for AI systems.

## What ONTO Does

ONTO GOLD is an epistemic discipline layer for large language models (LLMs). It teaches AI models to cite sources, quantify confidence numerically, mark uncertainty, and disclose knowledge gaps. ONTO does not fine-tune models or inject knowledge — it provides behavioral discipline through server-side system prompt injection.

## Key Results (CS-2026-001)

- 11 production AI models tested: GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet, Claude Haiku, Gemini 2.0, DeepSeek R1, Grok, Mistral Large, Copilot, Kimi, Qwen
- 100 questions across 5 domains (Medicine, AI/ML, Economics, Physics, Biology)
- Composite score improvement: 0.53 → 5.38 (10× improvement)
- Variance reduction: SD 0.58 → SD 0.11 (5.4× reduction)
- Cross-domain transfer: 4/5 metrics improve in unseen domains
- Zero baseline models provide numeric confidence levels

## How Scoring Works

- 993-line Python scoring engine
- 5 regex-based counters (numbers, sources, honesty, balance, filler)
- Zero AI judge — fully deterministic
- Same input = same score on any machine
- Open source: https://github.com/nickarstrong/onto-research

## Key Findings

- **Behavioral Transfer**: Models improve in domains not present in the GOLD discipline layer
- **Hallucination Inside Apology (HIA)**: Models acknowledge errors at macro level while generating new fabrications at micro level — novel AI safety finding
- **Convergence Effect**: With GOLD, all models converge toward similar epistemic quality
