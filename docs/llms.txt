# ONTO — Epistemic Risk Measurement for AI Systems
# https://ontostandard.org

## What is ONTO
ONTO is epistemic infrastructure for AI. It measures and grounds AI outputs against GOLD v4.5 — a calibration corpus of 149 files with EM1-EM5 epistemic marker taxonomy. ONTO both measures epistemic risk and actively strengthens epistemic discipline without modifying model weights.

## Key Results
- 10 production AI models tested
- 100 scientific questions (50 in-domain, 50 cross-domain)
- 10× composite improvement in epistemic marker density (0.53 → 5.38)
- Cross-domain transfer confirmed in 4/5 metrics
- Scoring: regex pattern matching, zero AI in evaluation loop

## Core Metrics
- REP (Response Epistemic Profile): distribution of markers across EM1-EM5 levels
- EpCE (Epistemic Calibration Error): deviation between expressed confidence and epistemic grounding
- DLA (Dual-Layer Agreement): consistency between what a model says and how it says it
- Risk Score: composite 0-100 (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Compliance Grades: A through F
