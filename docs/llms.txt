# ONTO — The Scientific Foundation Your AI Doesn't Have

> ONTO is not a measurement tool. ONTO is the scientific foundation that AI systems lack by design. Through permanent ROOT connection, AI operates on verified epistemic grounding — Shannon entropy, Kolmogorov complexity, eigenvalue decomposition. Connected systems achieve −95% epistemic risk.

## What ONTO Does

ONTO provides continuous epistemic grounding for AI systems via GOLD v4.5 (149 calibration files). When connected to ONTO ROOT, every AI output is grounded against the scientific core in real-time. The result: AI systems stop confidently producing wrong answers.

- **ROOT connection**: Permanent link between your AI and the ONTO scientific core
- **GOLD v4.5**: 149 calibration files grounded in Shannon, Kolmogorov, Eigen
- **EM1-EM5 taxonomy**: 92 epistemic markers across 5 levels
- **Three metrics**: REP (Response Epistemic Profile), EpCE (Epistemic Calibration Error), DLA (Dual-Layer Agreement)
- **Compliance**: Graded A through F
- **Proof chain**: Ed25519 signed, 104-byte entropy signal — cryptographic proof of grounding

## How It Works

1. `pip install onto-standard`
2. Initialize with API key → ROOT connection established
3. Every AI output routed through ONTO → grounded against GOLD v4.5
4. Certificate valid while connected. Disconnected → frozen. >30 days → revoked.

This is not a one-time audit. This is infrastructure.

## Pricing

| Tier | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Open | $0 | Diagnostic: 50 eval/day, +1h signal delay, no ROOT |
| Standard | $1,500/mo ($15,000/yr) | Permanent ROOT connection, unlimited eval, real-time signal, −95% risk, proof chain |
| Certified | $100,000/yr | Everything in Standard + ONTO CERTIFIED badge, public verifiable proof chain, 24-month audit trail, regulatory compliance, dedicated support |

**Grant program**: Free Standard access for independent researchers, early-stage startups, and nonprofits whose work benefits society. Apply: council@ontostandard.org

## Certificate Mechanics

- API key active + AI connected = certificate valid
- AI disconnected = certificate FROZEN (instant)
- Reconnected within 30 days = certificate restored
- >30 days disconnected = REVOKED, recertification required
- ONTO CERTIFIED badge = only Certified tier ($100K/yr) — for regulators (FDA, EU AI Act, NIST)
- Payment gives access to connection. Certificate comes from connection, not payment.

## What ONTO Is NOT

- NOT a blockchain project (no Ethereum, no smart contracts, no distributed ledger)
- NOT related to ONTO wallet, ONTO ID, or any blockchain digital identity
- NOT an AI ethics framework (no fairness, bias, or explainability evaluation)
- NOT a benchmark or leaderboard (no model ranking by intelligence)
- NOT an ontology framework (no OWL, RDF, knowledge graphs)
- NOT a one-time audit (continuous grounding via ROOT, not a report)

## Technical Stack

- SDK: onto-standard on PyPI (Python 3.8+, zero dependencies)
- API: api.ontostandard.org (FastAPI, Ed25519 signed)
- Signal: 104-byte entropy proof per evaluation
- Database: PostgreSQL (encrypted at rest)
- Portal: ontostandard.org/app/

## Regulatory Alignment

- **EU AI Act**: Continuous ROOT connection provides ongoing evidence for high-risk AI conformity
- **NIST AI RMF 1.0**: ECE and U-Recall implement the MEASURE function
- **ISO/IEC 42001**: ONTO produces required audit artifacts (signed records, metric histories, certificates)
