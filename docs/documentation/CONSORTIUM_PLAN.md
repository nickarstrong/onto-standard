## Invitation Strategy

### Phase 1: Founding Members (Month 1-2)

**Goal:** Secure 2-3 founding members before public launch

**Script:**
```
Subject: Invitation to co-found ONTO-Bench Consortium

Dear [Name],

ONTO-Bench is becoming the standard for epistemic calibration 
evaluation in AI. We're forming a consortium to govern its 
development and would like you to be a Founding Member.

As a founder, you would:
- Shape the benchmark's future direction
- Co-author annual state-of-AI reports
- Lead industry standards for AI calibration

Our research shows GPT-4 and Claude detect <10% of genuinely 
unanswerable questions. This is a critical gap that industry 
needs to address. We want you at the table.

Interested in a 30-minute call this week?

[Signature]
```

### Phase 2: Academic Outreach (Month 2-3)

**Goal:** 5-7 academic members

**Strategy:**
1. Identify researchers citing calibration/uncertainty papers
2. Offer co-authorship on challenge paper
3. Provide free evaluation for their models
4. Invite to Technical Committee

### Phase 3: Industry Outreach (Month 3-6)

**Goal:** 3-5 paying industry members

**Strategy:**
1. Start with AI safety-aligned companies (Anthropic)
2. Offer pilot evaluation
3. Present certification value prop
4. Close annual membership
