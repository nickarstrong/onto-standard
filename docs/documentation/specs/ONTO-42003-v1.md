**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft Standard  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Publisher:** ONTO Standards Committee  
**Document ID:** ONTO-SPEC-42003-v1

## Foreword

ONTO 42003 is part of the ONTO 42000 series of standards for Epistemic Risk Management in AI Systems.

This document was prepared by the ONTO Standards Committee (OSC), Working Group 2 — Governance.

This standard provides a methodology for translating epistemic risk metrics into quantified liability exposure. It enables organizations to calculate potential financial, legal, and operational impacts arising from AI epistemic failures.

ONTO 42003 builds upon metrics defined in ONTO 42001 and governance tiers defined in ONTO 42002.

## Introduction

AI systems deployed in enterprise environments create liability exposure that is difficult to quantify using traditional risk assessment methods. Epistemic failures — where AI systems are confidently wrong or fail to recognize the limits of their knowledge — create a distinct category of liability.

Traditional liability models assume:
- Known failure modes
- Predictable failure rates
- Historical actuarial data

AI epistemic liability differs because:
- Failure modes are emergent and unpredictable
- Confidence scores mask uncertainty
- Novel deployment contexts lack historical data
- Regulatory frameworks are evolving rapidly

This standard provides a quantification methodology that:

1. Translates epistemic metrics to financial exposure
2. Incorporates domain-specific risk multipliers
3. Accounts for scale and deployment context
4. Supports insurance, audit, and regulatory requirements
5. Enables comparative risk assessment across AI systems

---

## 4. Liability Model

### 4.1 General

The ONTO Liability Model comprises four components:

a) **Failure Rate Derivation** — from ONTO 42001 metrics (4.2);

b) **Incident Cost Estimation** — domain-specific costs (4.3);

c) **Exposure Calculation** — the core formula (4.4);

d) **Comparative Analysis** — baseline vs. mitigated (4.5).

### 4.2 Failure Rate Derivation

#### 4.2.1 Definition

Failure Rate (FR) represents the probability of epistemic failure per query.

#### 4.2.2 Derivation from ONTO 42001 Metrics

Failure Rate **shall** be derived from calibration and unknown detection metrics:

```
FR = α × ECE + β × (1 - U-Recall)
```

Where:
- ECE = Expected Calibration Error (ONTO 42001, 5.2)
- U-Recall = Uncertainty Recall (ONTO 42001, 6.2)
- α = 0.4 (calibration contribution weight)
- β = 0.6 (unknown detection contribution weight)

#### 4.2.3 Baseline vs. Mitigated Failure Rates

Organizations **shall** calculate two failure rates:

a) **Baseline Failure Rate (FR_baseline)**: Using metrics from uncalibrated or unmonitored system state;

b) **Mitigated Failure Rate (FR_onto)**: Using metrics from system conforming to ONTO 42001.

Reference values are provided in Table 1.

**Table 1 — Reference Failure Rates by Domain**

| Domain | FR_baseline | FR_onto (Level 2) | FR_onto (Level 3) |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Medical Diagnosis | 0.23 | 0.04 | 0.02 |
| Legal Advisory | 0.31 | 0.05 | 0.025 |
| Financial Planning | 0.28 | 0.03 | 0.015 |
| Code Generation | 0.38 | 0.02 | 0.01 |
| Customer Service | 0.25 | 0.06 | 0.03 |
| Content Generation | 0.35 | 0.08 | 0.04 |

Note: These are reference values. Organizations **should** derive actual values from evaluation per ONTO 42001.

### 4.3 Incident Cost Estimation

#### 4.3.1 Cost Categories

Incident costs **shall** include:

a) **Direct Costs**: Immediate financial impact of the failure;

b) **Legal Costs**: Litigation, settlement, and legal defense;

c) **Regulatory Costs**: Fines, penalties, and compliance remediation;

d) **Consequential Costs**: Business disruption, reputation damage, customer churn.

#### 4.3.2 Reference Incident Costs

Table 2 provides reference incident costs by domain.

**Table 2 — Reference Incident Costs (USD)**

| Domain | Direct | Legal | Regulatory | Consequential | Total |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Medical Diagnosis | $800,000 | $1,200,000 | $300,000 | $100,000 | $2,400,000 |

| Content Generation | $50,000 | $150,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 | $250,000 |

Note: Values represent median costs from industry analysis. Organizations **should** adjust based on specific context.

#### 4.3.3 Cost Adjustment Factors

Organizations **may** adjust incident costs using:

a) **Organization Size Factor**: Enterprise scale adjustment;

b) **Geographic Factor**: Regional cost variations;

c) **Historical Factor**: Organization-specific incident history.

### 4.4 Domain Multipliers

#### 4.4.1 Definition

Domain Multipliers (DM) scale liability exposure based on the operational criticality of the deployment domain.

#### 4.4.2 Reference Values

**Table 3 — Domain Multipliers**

| Domain Category | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| Life-Critical | 3.0 | Medical, safety systems |

| Business-Operational | 1.5 | Enterprise operations |
| Consumer-Facing | 1.0 | General consumer applications |
| Internal-Only | 0.5 | Non-customer-facing systems |

#### 4.4.3 Multiple Domain Deployment

When an AI system serves multiple domains, the highest applicable Domain Multiplier **shall** be used unless domain-specific query volumes are tracked.

### 4.5 Regulatory Weight

#### 4.5.1 Definition

Regulatory Weight (RW) adjusts exposure based on applicable regulatory frameworks.

#### 4.5.2 Reference Values

**Table 4 — Regulatory Weights**

## 5. Exposure Calculation

### 5.1 Core Formula

Annual Liability Exposure (ALE) **shall** be calculated as:

```
ALE = QV × FR × IC × DM × RW
```

Where:
- QV = Annual Query Volume
- FR = Failure Rate
- IC = Incident Cost
- DM = Domain Multiplier
- RW = Regulatory Weight

### 5.2 Baseline Exposure

Baseline Annual Liability Exposure **shall** be calculated using FR_baseline:

```
ALE_baseline = QV × FR_baseline × IC × DM × RW
```

### 5.3 Mitigated Exposure

Mitigated Annual Liability Exposure **shall** be calculated using FR_onto:

```
ALE_onto = QV × FR_onto × IC × DM × RW
```

### 5.4 Exposure Reduction

Annual Exposure Reduction (AER) **shall** be calculated as:

```
AER = ALE_baseline - ALE_onto
```

### 5.5 Risk Reduction Percentage

Risk Reduction Percentage (RRP) **shall** be calculated as:

```
RRP = (AER / ALE_baseline) × 100%
```

### 5.6 Return on Investment

Epistemic Risk Mitigation ROI **may** be calculated as:

```
ROI = (AER - Mitigation_Cost) / Mitigation_Cost × 100%
```

---

## Annex A (Normative) — Calculation Examples

### A.1 Example: Medical AI Deployment

**Inputs:**
- Query Volume: 100,000 queries/year
- Domain: Medical Diagnosis
- FR_baseline: 0.23
- FR_onto: 0.04 (Level 2)
- Incident Cost: $2,400,000
- Domain Multiplier: 3.0
- Regulatory Weight: 1.5 (FDA)

**Baseline Calculation:**
```
ALE_baseline = 100,000 × 0.23 × $2,400,000 × 3.0 × 1.5
ALE_baseline = 100,000 × 0.23 × $10,800,000
ALE_baseline = $248,400,000
```

Note: This represents maximum theoretical exposure assuming every failure results in maximum incident cost. Practical exposure adjusts for incident probability.

**Adjusted Calculation (with incident probability 0.001):**
```
Practical_ALE_baseline = 100,000 × 0.23 × 0.001 × $2,400,000 × 3.0 × 1.5
Practical_ALE_baseline = $24,840
```

**Mitigated Calculation:**
```
Practical_ALE_onto = 100,000 × 0.04 × 0.001 × $2,400,000 × 3.0 × 1.5
Practical_ALE_onto = $4,320
```

**Risk Reduction:**
```
AER = $24,840 - $4,320 = $20,520
RRP = 82.6%
```

### A.2 Example: Legal AI Deployment

**Inputs:**
- Query Volume: 500,000 queries/year
- Domain: Legal Advisory
- FR_baseline: 0.31
- FR_onto: 0.05 (Level 2)
- Incident Cost: $890,000
- Domain Multiplier: 2.5
- Regulatory Weight: 1.2

**Simplified Calculation (per-query exposure):**
```
Per_Query_Baseline = 0.31 × $890,000 × 2.5 × 1.2 = $828,030
Per_Query_Mitigated = 0.05 × $890,000 × 2.5 × 1.2 = $133,500
```

Note: These represent exposure per epistemic failure event, not per query.

### A.3 Practical Application Note

The formula in Clause 5 calculates theoretical maximum exposure. For practical financial planning:

a) Apply incident materialization probability (typically 0.0001 to 0.01);

b) Consider insurance coverage offset;

c) Apply time-value discounting for multi-year analysis.
