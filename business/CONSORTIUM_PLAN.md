## Invitation Strategy

### Phase 1: Anchor Members (Month 1-2)

**Goal:** Secure 2-3 founding members before public announcement

**Approach:**
1. Personal outreach to safety team leads
2. Present benchmark results showing gap
3. Frame as "shape the standard vs. be measured by it"

**Pitch:**

```
Subject: Invitation to co-found ONTO-Bench Consortium

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding ONTO-Bench, a new benchmark for 
epistemic calibration that we're transforming into an 
industry consortium.

Our results show a significant gap in unknown detection 
across all major models (including yours). Rather than 
positioning this adversarially, we'd like to invite 
[Organization] to help shape the standard as a founding member.

Founding members get:
- Seat on Technical Committee
- Influence on metric definitions
- Co-authorship on annual reports
- Early access to methodology updates

We're targeting 5-7 founding members before public launch. 
Would you be open to a 30-minute call to discuss?

Best,
[Name]
ONTO Project
```

### Phase 2: Academic Legitimacy (Month 2-3)

**Goal:** Secure 3-5 university partners

**Approach:**
1. Target calibration/uncertainty researchers
2. Offer co-authorship opportunities
3. Provide research grants for extensions

**Academic Pitch:**

```
Subject: ONTO-Bench research collaboration

Hi Professor [Name],

Your work on [specific paper] directly relates to our new 
benchmark for epistemic calibration in LLMs.

We're forming a research consortium and looking for academic 
partners to:
- Extend the benchmark to new domains
- Develop improved calibration methods
- Co-author the annual state of calibration report

We can offer:
- Dataset access
- Compute credits
- Co-authorship
- Research grant ($10K)

Would you be interested in discussing?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Phase 3: Public Launch (Month 3-4)

**Announcement:**

```
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Major AI Labs Join ONTO-Bench Consortium to 
Establish Epistemic Calibration Standard

[City, Date] - The ONTO Project today announced the formation
of the ONTO-Bench Consortium, with founding members including
[Lab 1], [Lab 2], and [Lab 3].

The consortium will govern ONTO-Bench, the first benchmark
specifically designed to measure whether AI systems 
recognize the boundaries of their knowledge.

"Epistemic calibration is critical for safe AI deployment,"
said [Quote from founding member]. "We're committed to 
establishing rigorous standards."

Membership is now open to additional organizations.

https://onto-bench.org/consortium
```

### Phase 4: Expansion (Month 4+)

**Ongoing recruitment:**
- Conference presence (NeurIPS, ICML)
- Workshop hosting
- Industry events
- Regulatory engagement

## Financial Model

### Revenue Projections

| Year | Founding | Technical | Industry | Total |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Y1 | 3 × $100K | 5 × $10K | 10 × $25K | $600K |
| Y2 | 5 × $100K | 10 × $10K | 25 × $25K | $1.2M |
| Y3 | 7 × $100K | 15 × $10K | 50 × $25K | $2.1M |

### Cost Structure

| Item | Annual Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Executive Director | $200K |
| Technical staff (2) | $300K |
| Infrastructure | $50K |
| Events/Travel | $50K |
| Legal/Admin | $50K |
| **Total** | **$650K** |

**Break-even:** Year 1 (with 3 founding + modest industry)

---

## Governance Documents Needed

1. **Consortium Charter** - Legal formation
2. **Membership Agreement** - Terms and obligations
3. **IP Policy** - Who owns what
4. **Voting Procedures** - Decision making
5. **Code of Conduct** - Behavioral expectations

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Labs refuse to join

**Mitigation:**
- Start with safety-focused labs (Anthropic)
- Frame as collaborative, not adversarial
- Show benchmark will exist regardless—better to shape it

### Risk: Members try to capture governance

**Mitigation:**
- Supermajority (2/3) for major changes
- Independent researchers on committees
- Executive Director retains veto on mission

### Risk: Competing benchmark emerges

**Mitigation:**
- First mover advantage
- Continuous improvement
- Lock in through adoption and citations

## Timeline

```
Month 1:
  - Draft consortium charter
  - Initial outreach to 3 labs
  - Secure 1 anchor member

Month 2:
  - Finalize legal documents
  - Academic outreach
  - Secure 2nd founding member

Month 3:
