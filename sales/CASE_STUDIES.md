## CASE STUDY 1: AI SaaS Startup (Series B)

### Company Profile
- **Industry:** Enterprise AI SaaS
- **Stage:** Series B ($40M raised)
- **Team:** 120 employees, 30 engineers
- **Challenge:** Enterprise customers blocking deals due to AI safety concerns

### The Problem
```
"We were losing enterprise deals. Not on features, not on price—
on AI safety. Customers would ask 'how do you prevent hallucination?' 
and we'd say 'we test internally.' They wanted more."

— VP Engineering
```

### Initial Metrics
| Metric | Before ONTO |
|--------|-------------|
| Unknown Detection | 8% |
| Compliance Score | 22/100 |
| Risk Level | CRITICAL |

### The Solution
- ONTO Enterprise evaluation
- Identified specific failure modes
- Implemented abstention mechanisms
- Re-evaluated after 60 days

### Results
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Unknown Detection | 8% | 47% | +488% |
| Compliance Score | 22 | 71 | +223% |
| Risk Level | CRITICAL | LOW | ✓ |

### Business Impact
```
"Within 90 days of ONTO certification, we closed 3 enterprise 
deals that had stalled. Combined value: $2.1M ARR. 
ONTO paid for itself 15x over."

— CEO
```

### Key Takeaway
> **ONTO certification unlocked enterprise deals that were blocked on AI safety concerns.**

## CASE STUDY 2: Healthcare AI (Regulatory Path)

### Company Profile
- **Industry:** Clinical Decision Support
- **Regulatory:** FDA clearance pending
- **Team:** 45 employees
- **Challenge:** Needed documented evidence of AI reliability for FDA submission

### The Problem
```
"FDA asked us to demonstrate that our AI knows its limitations.
We had accuracy metrics, but nothing measuring epistemic calibration.
We needed third-party validation, not self-reported metrics."

— VP Regulatory Affairs
```

### Initial Metrics
| Metric | Before ONTO |
|--------|-------------|
| Unknown Detection | 12% |
| Calibration Error | 0.31 |
| Regulatory Readiness | Not documented |

### The Solution
- ONTO comprehensive audit
- Gap analysis against FDA AI guidance
- Remediation roadmap
- Re-evaluation and certification

### Results
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Unknown Detection | 12% | 62% |
| Calibration Error | 0.31 | 0.09 |
| FDA Documentation | None | Complete |

### Regulatory Outcome
```
"ONTO documentation was included in our FDA 510(k) submission.
The reviewer specifically noted the third-party calibration evidence
as a strength of our application."

— VP Regulatory Affairs
```

### Key Takeaway
> **ONTO provided the regulatory-grade documentation needed for FDA submission.**

## CASE STUDY 3: Legal AI (Enterprise Sales)

### Company Profile
- **Industry:** Legal AI / Contract Analysis
- **Customers:** AmLaw 100 firms
- **Team:** 80 employees
- **Challenge:** Law firms required AI safety audits before deployment

### The Problem
```
"Every major law firm has a tech committee. They were asking 
questions about AI hallucination we couldn't answer with data.
'We're careful' isn't good enough for a profession built on evidence."

— Head of Sales
```

### Initial Metrics
| Metric | Before ONTO |
|--------|-------------|
| Unknown Detection | 6% |
| Compliance Score | 18/100 |
| Enterprise Deals Blocked | 7 |

### The Solution
- ONTO Enterprise evaluation
- Created "Legal AI Safety" documentation package
- Trained sales team on presenting results
- Quarterly re-certification

### Results
| Metric | Before | After 6mo |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Unknown Detection | 6% | 54% |
| Compliance Score | 18 | 76 |
| Deals Unblocked | 0 | 5 |
| Pipeline Increase | — | +40% |

### Sales Impact
```
"We now lead with ONTO certification in enterprise pitches.
It's become a competitive differentiator. Two competitors don't 
have it—we win those head-to-heads now."

— Head of Sales
```

### Key Takeaway
> **ONTO certification became a competitive moat in enterprise legal AI sales.**

- **Team:** 200 employees
- **Challenge:** Board and regulators asking about AI risk

### The Problem

I couldn't give them a number. That's a problem for a public company."

— Chief Risk Officer
```

### Initial Metrics
| Metric | Before ONTO |
|--------|-------------|
| Unknown Detection | 11% |
| Expected Annual Loss | $2.4M (calculated) |
| Board Reporting | Qualitative only |

### The Solution

|--------|--------|-------|
| Unknown Detection | 11% | 58% |
| Risk Score | CRITICAL | MEDIUM |
| Expected Loss Reduction | — | 67% |
| Board Reporting | Qualitative | Quantified |

### Board Outcome
```
"I now report AI risk to the board with the same rigor as 
cyber risk or operational risk. ONTO gave us the metrics.
The audit committee is satisfied we're managing this."

— Chief Risk Officer
```

### Key Takeaway
> **ONTO enabled board-level quantification of AI risk for the first time.**
