```
Subject: EU AI Act compliance - quick question

Hi [NAME],

EU AI Act requires documented evidence that your AI 
understands its limitations. Fines up to 6% of revenue.

Quick question: how is [COMPANY] planning to document this?

We built ONTO-Bench specifically for this—the only 
standardized benchmark measuring whether AI knows 
what it doesn't know.

Result: 91% of AI systems fail. Including GPT-4 and Claude.

Free pilot available. Report serves as compliance documentation.

15 minutes of your time. Worth a look?

## EMAIL 2: Liability Hook

```
Subject: AI hallucination liability at [COMPANY]

Hi [NAME],

One question: what happens when [COMPANY]'s AI 
confidently gives a wrong answer to an enterprise customer?

Not accuracy. Confidence on wrong answers.

We measure exactly this. GPT-4 detects genuinely 
unanswerable questions 9% of the time. The other 91%? 
Confident hallucination.

Free evaluation available. You'll know your liability 
exposure in 24 hours.

Interested?

## EMAIL 3: Competitor Pressure

```
Subject: How [COMPETITOR] is handling AI audits

Hi [NAME],

Just wrapped an epistemic evaluation for a company in [INDUSTRY].

They needed data on hallucination risk before their 
enterprise customers started asking.

Result: their AI confidently answered questions with 
no known answer 87% of the time. Now they have 
documentation showing they're addressing it.

Given [COMPANY] competes for the same customers, 
thought you might want similar data.

Free pilot. 15 minutes. Full report.

## EMAIL 4: Direct/Busy Executive

```
Subject: AI hallucination audit (free pilot)

[NAME] - 

We measure AI hallucination liability risk.

GPT-4 fails 91% on unknown detection.
Most AI systems are worse.

Free pilot evaluation for [COMPANY].
15 min → full executive report.

Yes or no?

## EMAIL 5: Research/Technical Hook

```
Subject: Our research on epistemic calibration (relevant to [PRODUCT])

Hi [NAME],

We published research showing frontier LLMs fail 
dramatically at recognizing when they don't know something.

Key finding: <10% unknown detection across GPT-4, Claude, Llama.

Paper: [ARXIV_LINK]
Leaderboard: onto-bench.org

Given [COMPANY] is building [PRODUCT], thought you 
might want to know where your model stands.

Free evaluation available. Takes 15 min.

## FOLLOW-UP 1 (Day 3)

```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

Hi [NAME],

Following up on my note about AI hallucination risk.

Quick summary: we measure whether AI knows its limits.
91% of models fail. Free pilot available.

Worth 15 minutes?

[YOUR NAME]

## FOLLOW-UP 2 (Day 7)

```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[NAME] - 

Last note on this. We help AI teams quantify 
hallucination liability before customers or regulators ask.

If timing isn't right, no problem. Just let me know 
and I'll check back next quarter.

If it is: free pilot takes 15 min, report in 24 hours.

Either way?

## LINKEDIN CONNECTION REQUEST

```
Hi [NAME], building AI risk measurement at ONTO. 
Saw your work at [COMPANY] - would love to connect.
```

---

## LINKEDIN FOLLOW-UP DM

```
Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: how is [COMPANY] measuring 
hallucination risk in your AI systems?

We built a benchmark showing 91% of LLMs confidently 
answer questions that have no known answer.

Happy to share research or run a free evaluation.
```

---

## WARM INTRO REQUEST

```
Hi [CONNECTOR],

I'm reaching out to AI teams about hallucination 
liability measurement. 

Do you know anyone at [TARGET COMPANY] working on 
AI safety/reliability who might be interested?

Happy to offer them a free evaluation if so.

Thanks!

## DISCOVERY CALL OPENER (After They Accept)

```
"Thanks for making time. Before I dive in—
what made you take this call?"

[Let them answer. Note their specific pain.]

"Got it. So you're dealing with [paraphrase].
Let me show you what we found..."
```

---

## PILOT CLOSE (End of Call)

```
"Here's what I'd suggest:

Let us run a free evaluation on your model.
You send predictions, we send report.
15 minutes of your time, 24 hours turnaround.

If the results are useful, we can talk about 
ongoing monitoring. If not, you've lost nothing.

Sound fair?

[If yes]

Great. I'll send instructions today.
Can you have predictions back by [DATE]?
Report will be in your inbox within 24 hours."
```

## PRICING CONVERSATION

When they ask "How much?":

```
"Depends on what you need.

One-time audit: $25K. 
Full evaluation, executive briefing, remediation roadmap.

Ongoing monitoring: $10K-$50K/month.
Continuous evaluation, compliance documentation, support.

But let's start with the free pilot and see if 
the data is useful first."
```

## KEY PHRASES TO USE

**Pain Language (Use These):**
- "Hallucination liability"
- "AI risk exposure"
- "Confident wrong answers"
- "Regulatory documentation"
- "Enterprise customer concerns"

**Technical Language (Avoid):**
- ~~"Epistemic calibration"~~
- ~~"ECE metric"~~
- ~~"Unknown detection recall"~~
- ~~"Calibration error"~~

**In Report:** Technical is fine.
**In Sales Conversation:** Pain language only.

---

## OBJECTION RESPONSES (Short Version)

**"No budget"**
→ "Free pilot shows the problem. Budget conversation after you see data."

**"We test internally"**
→ "You test accuracy. We test liability. Different thing."

**"Our model is fine"**
→ "Every model fails. Free pilot proves it either way."

**"Do it later"**
→ "When's your next enterprise deal? Having data before that conversation wins deals."

**"What's the catch"**
→ "No catch. Free pilot. If useful, you'll want more. If not, you're done."
