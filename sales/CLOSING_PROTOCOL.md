---

[ ] Follow up batch 1 non-responders
[ ] 10 LinkedIn connection requests

DAY 6-7:
[ ] Book discovery calls
[ ] Prepare pilot kit
[ ] Review pipeline
```

### Week 2-3: Pilots

```

[ ] Schedule 30-min walkthroughs
[ ] Collect feedback
[ ] Ask for referrals
```

### Week 4: Convert

```
[ ] Send proposals to warm pilots
[ ] Use PRICING.md SKUs
[ ] Apply 30-day urgency clause
[ ] Close 1-2 paid audits
```

**Target: $50K-$100K closed**

---

## PHASE 2: EXPAND (Days 30-60)

### Upsell Motion

```
Audit customer ($50K) → Monitoring conversation

Script:
"Now that you've seen your risk score, 
how are you planning to track remediation progress?

Our monitoring subscription includes:
- Monthly evaluations
- ONTO Trust Mark certification
- Compliance documentation

Most audit customers upgrade within 60 days.
Want me to send the proposal?"
```

### Add Customers

```
[ ] Continue cold outreach (50/week)
[ ] Leverage case studies from Phase 1
[ ] Ask for referrals from paid customers
[ ] Target: 3-5 new audits
```

**Target: $150K-$250K cumulative**

---

## PHASE 3: LOCK-IN (Days 60-90)

### Annual Contracts

```
Convert monitoring → annual prepay:
- 15% discount for annual
- Trust Mark included
- Budget certainty for customer

Script:
"Your first quarter has been valuable.
Annual contract locks in current pricing 
and includes Trust Mark certification.

Given regulatory timeline, most customers 
prefer annual commitment.

Ready to formalize?"
```

### Certification Launch

```
[ ] Issue first ONTO Trust Marks
[ ] Create verification page
[ ] Press release for first certifications
[ ] LinkedIn announcements
```

**Target: $300K-$500K ARR**

## OBJECTION QUICK KILLS

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "No budget" | "Free pilot costs nothing. Budget conversation after you see data." |
| "We test internally" | "You test accuracy. We test liability. Different thing." |
| "Our model is fine" | "GPT-4 fails 91%. Free pilot proves it either way." |
| "Do it later" | "EU AI Act enforcement starts 2025. Data now, decision later." |
| "Too expensive" | "One incident costs $5M+. We cost $50K. That's 100x ROI." |
| "What's the catch" | "No catch. Free pilot. If useful, you'll want more." |
| "Need to check with team" | "Understood. Can I send a one-pager for your [CTO/CFO/Legal]?" |
