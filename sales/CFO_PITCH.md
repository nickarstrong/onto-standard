# ONTO CFO Pitch Deck

## Purpose
This deck is for financial decision-makers. Focus on risk, liability, and ROI—not technical metrics.

---

## SLIDE 1: Title

**ONTO**

*AI Liability Insurance You Didn't Know You Needed*

[For: CFO / Finance / Risk Committee]

---

## SLIDE 2: The Financial Risk

**AI Hallucination Is Now a Balance Sheet Risk**

| Case | Outcome | Cost |
|------|---------|------|
| Air Canada chatbot | Court-ordered refund | $800K+ legal fees |
| Lawyer used ChatGPT | Sanctioned, case dismissed | Career + $50K+ |
| Healthcare AI advice | FDA warning letter | $10M+ remediation |

**Pattern:** AI confidently provides wrong information.
**Result:** Companies pay.

---

## SLIDE 3: Regulatory Exposure

**The Fines Are Real**

| Regulation | Maximum Fine | Status |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| **EU AI Act** | 6% global revenue | Enforcing 2025 |
| **FTC Section 5** | Per-violation penalties | Active enforcement |
| **State Laws** | Varies | NYC, CA, IL active |

**For a $100M company:**
EU AI Act max fine = **$6M**

---

## SLIDE 4: The Hidden Liability

**Your AI Has a Confidence Problem**

We tested leading AI systems on questions with **no known answer**:

| System | Correct Abstention | Confident Wrong Answer |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| GPT-4 | 9% | **91%** |
| Claude 3 | 8% | **92%** |
| Llama 3 | 6% | **94%** |

**Translation:**
When your AI should say "I don't know," it makes something up 90%+ of the time.

---

## SLIDE 5: Quantified Risk

**Expected Annual Loss Model**

```
For a $50M Revenue Company in Regulated Industry:

Lawsuit Risk:        5% × $5M   = $250K
Regulatory Risk:    12% × $3M   = $375K  
Lost Deals:         20% × $500K = $100K
Brand Damage:       50% × $1M   = $500K
                              ─────────
Expected Annual Loss:           $1.225M
```

*This is the liability sitting on your books today.*

---

|------|------------|----------|
| **Audit** | $50K one-time | Due diligence, baseline |

*Start with audit. Scale to monitoring.*

---

## SLIDE 10: Risk of Inaction

**What Happens If You Don't Act**

| Scenario | Probability | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| AI lawsuit | 5%/year | $5M+ |
| EU AI Act fine | 12%/year | 6% revenue |
| Lost enterprise deal | 20%/year | $500K+ |
| Competitor gets certified | 50%/year | Market share |

**The question isn't whether AI liability will materialize.
It's whether you'll have documentation when it does.**

---

## SLIDE 11: Decision Framework

**Three Questions for the Finance Committee**

1. **What is our current AI liability exposure?**
   → ONTO quantifies this.

2. **Can we defend our AI decisions in court/to regulators?**
   → ONTO provides documentation.

3. **What's the cost of NOT knowing?**
   → $1M+/year expected loss.

---

## CFO TALKING POINTS

### Opening
"Let me show you a liability that's probably not on your risk register yet."

### The Hook
"Your AI is making confident claims about things it can't know. That's not a technical problem—it's a liability problem."

### The Number
"Expected annual loss for a company your size: $1.2M. ONTO costs $120K. That's 10:1 ROI before considering the tail risk."

### The Close
"Free pilot. No cost to see if this is real for you. If the data isn't useful, you've lost nothing."

### Objection: "We have bigger priorities"
"What's bigger than an unquantified liability that could be 6% of revenue? EU AI Act enforcement starts 2025."

### Objection: "Our legal team hasn't flagged this"
"Because there's no standard metric to flag. We provide that metric. Most legal teams thank us after they see the report."

### Objection: "Let's revisit next quarter"
"Regulators aren't waiting. Your enterprise customers aren't waiting. The pilot takes 48 hours and costs nothing."
