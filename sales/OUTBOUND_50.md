## EMAIL TEMPLATES (BATCH-SPECIFIC)

### Template A: Legal AI

```
Subject: Hallucination liability in legal AI

Hi [NAME],

Quick question: what happens when [COMPANY]'s AI 
confidently cites a case that doesn't exist?

(It happened. Lawyer got sanctioned.)

We measure exactly this risk—whether AI knows 
when it can't reliably answer.

GPT-4 fails 91% on our benchmark. 
Legal-specific models often do worse.

Free audit available. 7 days to report.
Worth knowing your risk?

[YOUR NAME]
ONTO
```

### Template B: Healthcare AI

```
Subject: FDA AI guidance + [COMPANY]

Hi [NAME],

FDA's AI/ML guidance requires documenting 
AI system limitations.

Question: how is [COMPANY] documenting 
epistemic boundaries?

We provide the benchmark regulators 
will likely reference.

Free evaluation available.
Report shows exactly where your AI 
confidently hallucinates.

Interested?

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Template C: Enterprise AI

```
Subject: Enterprise AI safety audit

Hi [NAME],

When enterprise customers ask about 
hallucination risk, what data do you show them?

We tested frontier models. GPT-4 detects 
genuinely unanswerable questions 9% of the time.

ONTO certification is becoming the standard 
enterprise customers expect.

Free pilot available.
See your score before customers ask.

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Template D: Fintech AI

Hi [NAME],

[YOUR NAME]
```

### Template E: AI Infrastructure

```
Subject: Partnership opportunity - ONTO certification

Hi [NAME],

Your customers are building with LLMs.
Their customers are asking about hallucination risk.

Opportunity: integrate ONTO epistemic metrics 
into [COMPANY] platform.

whether AI knows what it doesn't know.

## LINKEDIN OUTREACH

### Connection Request
```
Hi [NAME], working on AI epistemic risk standards

Thanks for connecting!

Quick question: how is [COMPANY] measuring
