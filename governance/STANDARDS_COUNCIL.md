## OUTREACH TEMPLATE

```
Subject: Advisory role - ONTO Standards Council

Dear [NAME],

I'm establishing the ONTO Standards Council to develop 
industry standards for AI epistemic calibration—measuring 
whether AI systems recognize the boundaries of their knowledge.

Given your expertise in [FIELD], I'd like to invite you 
to serve as an Advisory Board member.

Commitment: ~4 hours/quarter
Compensation: $[X]/year + equity
Impact: Shape how AI reliability is measured and regulated

Our benchmark shows GPT-4 detects genuinely unanswerable 
questions only 9% of the time. We're building the standard 
that addresses this gap.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to discuss?

Best,
[NAME]
ONTO Project

## LEGITIMACY SIGNALS

### Why Council Matters

1. **Enterprise Trust**
   - "Independent advisory board" → not one-person company
   - Named experts → borrowed credibility
   - Governance structure → institutional permanence

2. **Regulatory Weight**
   - Experts can testify
   - Standards body format familiar to regulators
   - Multi-stakeholder = balanced

3. **Sales Enablement**
   - "ONTO Standards Council certified" > "ONTO certified"
   - Advisors can make introductions
   - Press coverage for announcements
